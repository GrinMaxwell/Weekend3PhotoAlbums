# Photo Album Viewer

### Assignment: Create a photo gallery application which allows users to view their albums as well as the individual photos contained within. We'll implement this as a single page application (SPA).

## Build Order
1. Initialize file structure (set up dist and app directories, make all the basic files: index.html, main.js, main.scss--compiling to main.css, data.js, readme.md, .gitignore and .surgeignore)
2. Basic HTML - but leave header/footer empty to populate the contents via javascript and jquery
3. Connect everything and test it's connections (log something to console from data.js and add some css to the app div)
4.
